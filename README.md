# LearningMEANAuth
Learning MEAN Stack with authentication using JWT.

I followed these two tutorials to build the app:

- [Angular 13 Login and Registration example with JWT and Web Api](https://www.bezkoder.com/angular-13-jwt-auth/)
- [Node.js + MongoDB: User Authentication & Authorization with JWT](https://www.bezkoder.com/node-js-mongodb-auth-jwt/)

I opted to use typescript for the backend as well, and uses custom linting rules specified in `backend/.eslintrc`.
